It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products.

He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas.

      "\n",
      "* Accelerating development to meet the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "* Empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "* Focusing on agriculture and the importance of \"Seed to Food\"\n",
      "* Overcoming problems through partnership and courage\n",
      "* Defending the nation and its values\n",
      "* Promoting connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "* Building a youth movement to achieve a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He also shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He commends her question and assures her that it is a thoughtful and important question that he will work towards answering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that their dream will be taken to the highest institution of the nation, indicating that they will work to make it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering India's youth and villages to achieve development. The speaker, likely the President of India at the time, shares their experience of visiting a village in Nagaland and seeing the impact of empowered village councils. The speech highlights the need to provide physical connectivity to rural areas through quality roads and to mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which is providing urban amenities to rural areas through the PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex. This includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic connectivity. The initiative has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of empowering India's youth and villages to achieve development and competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Area) program in Thanjavur district. Through the support of 1000 self-help groups, the program has generated employment and created entrepreneurs, transforming 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land. The villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing. The program has also enabled the villagers to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of Japanese experts. The speaker suggests that establishing 7000 PURAs across the country is necessary to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences: one with over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they explored various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of increasing agricultural production, improving economic conditions, and empowering farmers to protect the land for a second green revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is about meeting a wheelchair-bound individual named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who has no hands and legs, but is extremely happy and confident. When asked what he needed, he replied that he didn't need anything, but would like to sing in front of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes two experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker meets a physically challenged individual who is passionate about music. Despite his limitations, he sings beautifully and wants to share his talent with others. The speaker is touched by his talent and perseverance, and notes that with positive attitude and support, anyone can overcome their challenges and share their gifts with others.\n",
      "2. The speaker visits a village in Jammu & Kashmir that was affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage and loss, the villagers are resilient and have worked together to overcome their problems. The speaker is impressed by their courage and ability to take control of their situation, rather than allowing the disaster to defeat them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes the speaker's experiences and observations during relief operations and visits to affected areas after natural disasters. The speaker highlights the bravery and resilience of children and villagers who participated in relief efforts, including a visit to Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami. The speaker is touched by the courage and kindness of the tribal islanders, who consider the affected victims as their own children and do not have an orphanage on the island. The speaker also mentions a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which was sung with the villagers and reflects their determination to overcome challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a project that would connect 53 African countries with an estimated cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, and 53 tele-medicine and tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project in Ethiopia has already been commissioned, with Indian and African universities and hospitals participating. The project aims to provide seamless and integrated network connectivity, including satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by the President of India, and it covers three main topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. India's technological cooperation with Africa: The President mentions that India has been providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Ethiopia's Black Lion Hospital since 2006, using the Pan African network. He expresses pride that Indian technology is helping to bring about societal transformation in Africa.\n",
      "2. Defending the nation: The President talks about his experiences visiting Indian military bases and interacting with soldiers, sailors, and air warriors. He expresses pride in their bravery and dedication to their duty, highlighting their vigilance in guarding the nation and countering threats. He also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces and police personnel in maintaining public safety.\n",
      "3. Youth movement for a Developed India 2020: The President mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working to transform Indian youth into enlightened citizens. He does not provide further details about this initiative, but seems to be endorsing the effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the district administration. The speaker shares examples of the positive impact of the training, including increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and recognition of duties towards the nation. They also share a personal anecdote about a student leader who was inspired to help her father quit smoking after participating in the training. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the potential of India's 540 million youth below the age of 25 to shape the country's future through value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech focuses on the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, while also emphasizing the country's economic growth and progress. The speaker highlights the country's natural resources, its hardworking people, particularly the 540 million youth, and the confidence they have in India's ability to become a developed nation by 2020. The speaker also emphasizes the need to empower members of society, particularly the youth, to aim high and work towards their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with a call to action, outlining a distinct profile for a developed India by 2020. This includes reducing the rural-urban divide, ensuring equitable access to energy and water, promoting a harmonious relationship between agriculture, industry, and the service sector, providing education with a value system to all meritorious candidates, and making India the best destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker envisions a future where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Healthcare is accessible to everyone\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty is eradicated, illiteracy is removed, and crimes against women and children are absent\n",
      "* The society is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expresses gratitude to the citizens for their support over the past 5 years. He also shares his personal mission to connect the hearts and minds of all Indians, instilling self-confidence and the sense that \"we can do it\".
